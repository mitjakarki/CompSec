Most of the head matter and other flags are probably irrelevant, but included here for completeness. There is &nbsp;this funny flag too. <b><u>Here's some bold and underlined stuff.</u></b><u></u> Now bold and underline should both be off, although they are taken off in the same order they were put on instead of in nested fashion.<br>
